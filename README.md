# Projected-Pharmacist-Job-Market
My aunt recently asked me if I thought that pharmacy school was a good choice for her daughter. She told me that a pharmacist she knew had told her that jobs were getting hard to find, and asked if I knew anything about it. As the family data nerd, I told her that I'd prepare a report for her.
I made reports of the number of graduating pharmacy students vs the expected number of jobs in 2017.
I then projected the national and state-by-state job market out until 2024.

Webscraper for PharmCAS.R  
        There was no easy table of pharmacy schools by attendance, so I wrote this to scrape PharmCAS  
Pharmacist Job Projection.SAS  
        Used to calculate numbers and to generate the final report
