Code:
  The web scraper is found in "Web Scraper for PharmCAS.R"
   
  The program that generated the report is found in "Pharmacist Job Projection.sas"


Data:
 The list of pharmacy schools in the US was obtained from 

     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pharmacy_schools_in_the_United_States

     and is contained in "Pharmacy Schools by State.csv"





  The expected employment nationally and by state was found on 
   
     http://projectionscentral.com/Projections/LongTerm

     and is contained in "Pharmacist Job Outlook.csv"






  Because there was no easily-accessed table of pharmacy school class size, I wrote a web scraper to extract attendance data from
  
       http://www.pharmcas.org/school-directory/#/pharmd/general-information. 

      I manually filled in any gaps with additional data found on 

       http://pharmacy-schools.startclass.com/
